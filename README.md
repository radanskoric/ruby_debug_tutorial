# Interactive Ruby Debug Tutorial

This is an introduction tutorial for Ruby debug inside ruby debug itself.

The instructions are woven through the code you are debugging at the moment.
It's all very meta. I hope you like it.

All you need is a working installation of [Ruby 3.3+](https://www.ruby-lang.org/).

To start the tutorial clone this repo locally and run the following command in your terminal:
```bash
rdbg intro.rb
```
Don't read the source code because it will spoil the fun. :)

Did I just ask you to run a piece of code without inspecting it??
I guess I did. Yes, I know, it's a lot to ask.

If you're security minded or just don't have Ruby 3.3+ installed,
you can also use Docker. Just run:
```
./run_with_docker.sh
```
Reading that file and Dockerfile will not spoil the fun, so please go ahead. :)
