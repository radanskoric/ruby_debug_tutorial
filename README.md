# Interactive Ruby Debug Tutorial

This is an introduction tutorial for Ruby debug inside ruby debug itself.

The instructions are woven through the code you are debugging at the moment.
It's all very meta. I hope you like it.

All you need is a working installation of [Ruby 3.3+](https://www.ruby-lang.org/).

To start the tutorial clone the repo locally and run the following command in your terminal:
```bash
rdbg intro.rb
```
